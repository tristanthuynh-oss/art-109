        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>Hello, My name is Tristan Than Son Huynh. I am a digital artist who kinda does a little of everything because I'm more a project guy than a specialist. I see a project and I learn the skills I need to kinda make it work, its a very hit or miss system because I am quite ambitious and often my mind reaches farther than my hands can grab

<p>Regardless I have fun all the same. I'm a DMA Major at San Jose State University and I also do a lot of work relating to TTTRPGs but mostly digital art and some game design here or there</p>

          <h3>Date-A-Neko, 2025</h3>
          <p>This was my final for my "Intro To Coding" class and while most people made a clock or something basic. I decided that I wanted to make a game. It was supposed to be  asmall demo
            but it ended up being a full game
          </p>
              You are a funny little cat and your goal to is to score a date to a dance in small mini-game. It's nothing too crazy but for something made after only a couple of months of learning to code with no prior experience. I'd say thats pretty cool.
          </p>
          <p>Fun story, when I first finished the game and the documentation something went wrong with the transfer to the live servers and I ended up losing almost all of my files related to this game with three days left before that project was due. So I ended spending 13 real hours straight, doing nothing but re-coding and remaking every asset and line which was an experience.</p>

          <p>This was a recent project when I started getting into game design, my first stint using a dedicated gaming engine. That was engine was, of course, Unity.</p>
