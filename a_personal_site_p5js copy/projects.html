          <h3>Date-A-Neko, 2025</h3>
          <p>This was my final for my "Intro To Coding" class and while most people made a clock or something basic. One of the prompts was to make an interative art piece and so I decided that I wanted to make a game. It was supposed to be  asmall demo
            but it ended up being a full game. 
          </p>
              You are a funny little cat and your goal to is to score a date to a dance in small mini-game. It's nothing too crazy but for something made after only a couple of months of learning to code with no prior experience. I'd say thats pretty cool.
          </p>
          <p>Fun story, when I first finished the game and the documentation something went wrong with the transfer to the live servers and I ended up losing almost all of my files related to this game with three days left before that project was due. So I ended spending 13 real hours straight, doing nothing but re-coding and remaking every asset and line which was an experience.</p>

          <h3>Rat Attack, 2025</h3>
          <p>This was a recent project when I started getting into game design, my first stint using a dedicated gaming engine. That was engine was, of course, Unity.</p>
          <p>You are the chef defend yourselves from the rats who try to eat your cheese. Your goal is to survive as much as possible before being overwhelmed by the rats</p>
           <p>This was my first real honest game and it was rough. Often I found myself with many scripting errors with a more advanced system where I'd learned very different concepts like wiring, parent and childing, and other frustatingly neccesary concepts</p>

          <h3>Self Playing Video Game, 2024</h3>
          <p>This was one of my earliest big forays into the digial art sphere, in fact this was my final for my "Intro to Digital Art" class.</p>
                    <p>This project was a lot of firsts for myself, I learned Adobe After Effects, pixel art, video editing. A true leaping point to my future career in digital art.</p>
          <p>As someone who's always been an avid gamer, even in this facsimile of a video game it was very magical experience of simulating a rpg battle. However rudimentary it came out to be. It was the fact 
            that I did that. I made it look like a video game with the atmosphere of someone interacting with an RPG. It was quite a inspiring experience.
