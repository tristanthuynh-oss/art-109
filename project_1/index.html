                Today we are in New Eridu. Its a peaceful, yet lively town that brings the homely vibes front and center. Met some of the shop owners and they were very welcoming. I highly recommend Coff Cafe's Special for that extra brim of energy. For a good slurp of goodness, I highly recommend General Chop's Bowl of Pork Chop Ramen.

                This time, we'll be heading into the Hollow to beat up some Ethereals. Here, we can see within what cohabits the Hollow. Remnants of what could've been a bustling city that once brimmed with life. Nowadays, its been quarantined into an area infected with Miasma polluting the environment. The average person cannot sustain being in the Hollow for a long time so be sure to keep track of how long you've been inside. Otherwise, you'll become an Ethereal.

                Time to refreshen up on my characters. I farmed for Specialized Shock Chips at the HIA to prepare for the future release of Sunbringer, my most anticipated character. It was relatively easy to do 3 times because my team is overpowered. Anyways, the interior of the HIA makes you feel like you're about to enter a simulation where you can play video games however much you want. I just wish it had refreshments on the side to cover my hunger over prolonged gametime.

                I'm here at the Port Elpis to take in a fishing break over how overwhelming life has gotten. The vibes of this port are really nice. We have a small Burger joint that just opened here recently and its got some customers. Seagulls, from time to time, will try to steal a fry or two from you. Moving on, Heres the fishing area that I decided to try out for the first time and yeah, the catch was not impressive. A small itty bitty shrimp that just so happened to catch on my line while I was trying to run away from responsibilities. I'm such a small fry man.

                Since its Fun Day Friday, I was feeling in an entertainment mood so I decided to head over to the Cinema at Lumina Square. This is what the front of the Cinema looks like. Several movies that I've seen before but my all time favorite is Starlight Knight. It has that Power Rangers vibe that I will always admire about the movie. The choreography, mechs, and team poses are all so amazing to rewatch and enjoy for centuries to come.

                Gotta love the weekends, Here we are back in New Eridu but most importantly, Godfinger Arcade. I spend most of my time here to try to one up my own high scores. I especially love to play Mach 25 because its not just about speed, its about stability over a prolonged amount of dodging toxic spikes. Highly recommend on a weekend.

                Here we are, Sunday Funday. Today, I wanted to go see my favorite actress, Astra at the Starloop Tower. I only ended up instead looking at her poster on the walls there. Welp, I guess I'll have to find out the schedule for the next time she has her next concert. But anyways, this is the interior of the Starloop Tower. It has a Common area and a VIP Lounge. Man I really want those front row seats to her show. They're really expensive to secure but considering its Astra, I'm going to need to grind hard for that comfortable seat.
            </p>
      <p>
              How much of an AstraNaut are you?

                Wow this was quite a week of gaming if I say so myself. I pretty much had fun with this project because it was literally homework disguised as an excuse for me to game on my favorite gacha game and really be immersed in its environment. I would say I had a lot of fun utilizing the camera function more because I got to explore so much of the game that I've come to really appreciate the time given into the design of the places and the people that live within it. If I'd do this project again, I would love to give it the dedicated amount of time and care to explore more places within ZZZ where I can highlight the animals that coexist in this space.
