       <h1>I Think Therefore I am</h1>
       <p>Micheal woke up early in the morning at 9 am. He was a college student but his next class was taken in an online meeting at 10 am so he had plenty of time to prepare himself for the day ahead. He went out of his room and into his kitchen to make himself some breakfast. As he opens his refrigerator he notices that he has so many choices on what he could eat. Milk and cereal, eggs and toast, bacon and eggs, omelets, anything that could be considered a conventional breakfast, its ingredients were sitting there waiting to be made.</p>
      <p>Overwhelmed by such options, Micheal decided to take out his phone and snapped a picture of his open fridge and with a question on what to eat to his A.I. virtual assistant, “Moops”. After waiting a minute, Moops suggested that he eat milk and cereal, but to help with his nutrition he should pour in a tablespoon of olive oil. Slightly perturbed by this suggestion but nonetheless, satisfied, he eats his designated meal as per the instructions given to him by his AI assistant. </p>
      <p>As Micheal ate breakfast he decides would like to watch some entertainment. Pulling out his phone again while eating his olive enhanced meal, Micheal goes to his favorite social media application, GlipGlap. A social media platform where a person can scroll through various short-form videos that are automatically generated based on an algorithm with information provided by Moops. Micheal scrolled and scrolled, through various trends, dramas, and news. Each video held his attention for seconds at a time as he quickly grew bored and swiped to the next video. Long had he finished his breakfast and was absent-mindingly staring at his phone. Suddenly, Moops interrupted his entertainment to remind him his next class started in 5 minutes. Micheal quickly cleaned up his mess and closed Glipglap and opened another application, “Surge”.</p>
      <p>As class began and his professor greeted everyone before starting their lecture, Micheal quickly became bored again. Asking Moops to transcribe and give him a quick synopsis of the lecture as it was happening, he then re-opened GlipGlap and continued scrolling through and watching entertainment. An hour passes and the class concludes. Micheal asks Moops what the class was about and if there were any assignments. Moops answers that the class lecture was about the French artist Vivienne Dominique and their works such as “El Chico de la Manzana” and “Der englische Fehler”, the assignment was to write a short-essay on her life and the effects of her work on the Society of Leopold that is due in a week. Micheal was frustrated at the prospect of writing a short essay in a week and went to his room to open his laptop and went to a website that hosted an A.I. assistant, “Gleepeedee”. He wrote down a request to write a short 1500 word essay about Vivienne Dominique. Seeing himself as a “prompt engineer”, he made sure to write down some specifications, “College-Level, Human, Beautiful”. Before he sent in his question he felt like something was wrong, something about the way he was doing this, something that felt pervasive and yet made him feel like he was missing something. “Ah yes.” he thought to himself, quickly adding the word “Masterpiece” to the end of his prompt before sending it to Gleepeedee. The A.I quickly generated an essay for him while complementing Micheal that he had a thorough prompt that was well structured, which pleased him greatly. Fulfilled with his exemplary writing ability, he made a PDF of the essay and sent it to his professor. 
</p>
<p>Now finished with his assignments after a hard 10 minutes of work, he was unsure of how to spend the rest of his day. He asks Moops what he should do. Moops suggests that he should go send a message to his mother as Moops reminds Micheal that he hasn’t been talking to her lately. Loathed to the idea of having to talk to his mother, Micheal prompts the A.I. assistant to write him some messages to send to his mother. Shortly after sending those messages, his mother writes back. Annoyed that his time was being wasted he prompts Moops to read the response from his mother and to write back in an appropriate manner. Finding himself stressed from his intense social interaction, he decides to go back to bed and spend the rest of the day on his favorite app, “GlipGlap”. As he continuously scrolled and viewed videos, his eyes started to become heavy with exhaustion. So he decided to close his eyes and sleep, content that he did the best he could that day.</p>
